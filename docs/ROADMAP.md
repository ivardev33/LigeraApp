# Ligera — Roadmap & session log

Working memory for where the product has been and where it is going.
Update this file every time a feature ships to keep it accurate.

## Session log

### MVP (local first, shipped)
- v0 base scaffolded by v0 (Next.js 16 / React 19 / TS 5.7 / Tailwind v4 /
  shadcn/ui / Recharts / lucide).
- Workout screen: multi-exercise draft, kg/reps steppers, rest timer, Finish → save.
- Progress screen: real 1RM chart (Epley), stat cards, PRs.
- Everything stored in localStorage.

### Supabase integration (shipped)
- `@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr` installed.
- SQL migration `0001_init.sql`: profiles, workouts, workout_exercises,
  workout_sets, RLS (owner-only for everything except username reads),
  profile auto-create trigger on signup.
- `lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts` + root `proxy.ts` (replaces the
  old `middleware.ts`; Next 16 convention).
- `lib/data.ts` (fetch/save), `lib/auth.ts` (session/user/profile + auth actions).
- Auth screen, user menu, session gate in `page.tsx`. Async save + error toast.
- Rebranded "Iron Log" → **Ligera**.

### Routine templates + History (shipped)
- `lib/workout-data.ts`: 25 Spanish exercises, `routineDays` (5 days), targets
  (`4 × 5–7 · RIR 1.5–2`), `RoutineExercise`/`RoutineDay`/`DraftSet`/`DraftExercise`.
- Workout screen: "Start routine day" pre-fills template exercises with last-logged
  weights; "Add exercises manually" keeps custom names; per-exercise X to remove.
- New **History** tab (3rd) with expandable per-workout detail, duration, set/volume counts.
- Exercise cards show the target string.

### Delete in History + RIR + smart rest + auto-progression + PWA (current iteration)
- Delete a whole workout, or a single exercise inside an expanded past workout,
  from History with confirmation dialogs.
- RIR per set: nullable `rir` column on `workout_sets` (migration `0002_rir.sql`),
  tappable RIR badge (0–3) on each set row, RIR shown on history set chips.
- Rest timer duration per exercise (`restSeconds` in routine data) and timer resets
  when a new set is completed.
- Auto-progression hint: "↑ Next: +2.5 kg" on routine exercises that hit the top of
  the target rep range in the previous session.
- PWA: installable manifest, service worker (network-first navigation),
  generated icons, registration in the root layout.

## Decisions (and why)

- **Normalized schema** (4 tables) instead of JSONB per-workout — keeps the door
  open for the friend-competition leaderboard while remaining simple.
- **Online-only saves**: no offline cache for data. Rationale: user trains in a gym
  with reliable connection; keeps save/refresh trivial. PWA caches only static assets.
- **Exercise names in Spanish**: they mirror Ivar's training PDF; UI chrome stays English.
- **Aware the app does not work offline** for data; documented, not a bug.
- **`proxy.ts` over `middleware.ts`**: deprecated in Next.js 16.
- **Supabase anon key is public** by design; never put the service-role key client-side.

## Known issues (to fix)

- After finishing a workout, History/Progress refresh via the `ligera:workouts-changed`
  event. If a screen still shows stale data after a save/delete, that event flow broke.
- RIR history chips show the value but there is no RIR aggregation in Progress yet
  (nice future addition: average RIR / effort per week).

## Backlog / ideas

- **Friends competition** (north star): friendships + invite-by-username,
  weekly volume leaderboard. Schema support already planned (profiles reads open).
- Average RIR per week in Progress.
- Deload reminder (the PDF calls for deload every 6–8 weeks).
- Google OAuth sign-in (email/password is in place).
- Workout timer pause on app background.
